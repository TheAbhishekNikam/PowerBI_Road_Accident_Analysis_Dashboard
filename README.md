# Global Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

##  Overview
The **Global Road Accident Analysis Dashboard** is an interactive **Power BI** dashboard that provides in-depth insights into road accident trends, severity, causes, driver demographics, weather impact, and economic losses across different regions worldwide.

This project helps policymakers, analysts, and road safety authorities understand accident patterns, identify key risk factors, and implement effective safety measures.

##  Key Features
- **Total Accidents Overview:** Displays total accidents, fatalities, injuries, and economic losses.
- **Accident Trends Over Time:** Visualizes accident occurrences from different years.
- **Accidents by Severity & Cause:** Breakdown of accident severity (Minor, Moderate, Severe) along with common causes like speeding, drunk driving, and mechanical failures.
- **Impact of Road & Weather Conditions:** Analyzes how different road conditions (wet, icy, snow-covered, dry) and weather (foggy, rainy, windy) affect accident rates.
- **Geographical Distribution:** An interactive map visualization of accidents worldwide, highlighting the most affected areas.
- **Driver Gender Distribution:** Visual representation of accidents categorized by male and female drivers.
- **Accidents by Speed & Road Type:** Insights into how different speed limits and road types (highways, streets, main roads) contribute to accidents.
- **Interactive Slicers & Filters:** Users can dynamically filter data based on year, location, weather, severity, and accident type.
